Greetings fellow capsuleers this is Zaporozh, the original CEO of
Glauxian Brothers, founded in 2005 with my close friend and ally
Promorpheux.  During this period of diversity and universal experience
Glaux made its mark in EVE.  As a group we were a recognized highly
skilled Industrial powerhouse.  With an extension POS network, capital
ship production and established trade routes we dominate our small area
of low sec space in the Khanid Region.  Sadly, due to real life situations I
departed EVE in 2009 and sold off the corp and the plethora of assets it
had accumulated over the 4 year span of continued growth.  I no longer
have the orginal "Zaporozh" character he is owned by a null sec player who
will not part with this amazing character. I do still have Zap2 the
trusty freighter pilot in our group who ferried countless billions in
freight over the glorious 4 years of our reign.  My old alt character
Zap2 will now be the appointed CEO of Glauxian Brothers and we will
establish a new home base in Zatamaka an entry system where Glaux seeded
most of the low-sec region with countless Jump Freighter runs.
"Zaporosh Glaux" will be my secondary character in training for long
range directives yet to be established.

1. Currently in progress. Re-establish Glaux Brothers in the
   Low-sec system Zatamaka as our entry point into low sec spacw where
   Glaux has always shined in EVE.
1. Recruit 5 new members to fill "key" operative positions to
   extend growth in corp.
1. Establish a "sustainable" corporate POS in Zatamaka that pays
   for itself through moon mining, production, and corporate support (ice
   mining ops, ore mining ops etc to purchase fuel)
1. Establish a profitable seeding program utilizing the corporate
   Jump Freighter "Zatamaka Express" (Ark based Jump Freighter that will
   allow Glaux to ferry needed items into low sec space for re-supply and
   profit style ventures.)

We need the following:

**The Boss:** _Filled_ "Zap2"

**Corporate Director:** _Open_ 2nd man in charge:  Pretty much the boss when
Zap2 is not around and will adhere to all directives from Zap and will
monitor and support all corporate activities and support goals.

**Systems Chief:** _Open_ This important role will be filled by a player who
plays often at least 5 times a week and will monitor and govern all
assigned systems for corporate mining ops, assisted freight runs and
selected projects and will work with corporation Director for long term
corporate projects *example: System POS, fuel delivery, defence etc.).
The first 3 systems we will be inhabiting will be "Shokal" to house our
"newer" players and to provide a more comfortable location for them to
acclimate to the EVE Universe and to ready themselves for game time in
"Zatamaka".  We will also set up shop in "Piri" a unique high sec system
with no system stations that is sandwich between two low sec systems.
We will establish a corporate POS in this system prior to Zatamaka to
allow our more advance players to live and work in this "controlled"
Environment.

**Corporate Recruiter:** _Open_ This very important position is crucial to
re-establishing this once dominant corporation in EVE.  The first goal
will be to recruit 5 active players assign them all corporate roles and
develop 1 assistant recruiter out of the bunch.  The next recruiting run
will focus on getting 10 more "active" players will assigned roles in
the corp.

**Diplomacy contact:** _Open_ This is another key position in Glaux as
keeping our enemies close and in view is as important in making reliable
and strategically important allies in the EVE Changing Universe of EVE
Online

**Social Media Director:** This important position will be in charge of
the corporate website, assisting in creating corporate emails for better
internal and external communications, updating and expanding our corporate
description when neeeded and directing furture ad campaigns to assist the
reruitment diretor in bringing in new members.
